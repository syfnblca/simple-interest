It demonstrates basic GitHub repository setup and the use of Bash scripting for simple mathematical operations.

## 📘 Formula

The formula used to calculate Simple Interest (SI) is:


Where:  
- **Principal** → the initial amount of money  
- **Rate** → the annual interest rate (in %)  
- **Time** → the time period (in years)

💡 Example
Enter Principal: 1000

Enter Rate of Interest: 5

Enter Time (in years): 2

Simple Interest = 100.00
